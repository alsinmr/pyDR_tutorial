    "In the previous chapter, we established that if we have an experimental measurements, $R_\\zeta^\\theta$ (denoted $R_\\zeta^{(\\theta,S)}$ for rank-2 tensor correlation functions), which have linear relationships to the correlation function, then we can take linear combinations of the experimental measurements to get so-called *detector responses* which provide correlation time windows, i.e. *detector sensitivities*, $\\rho_n(z)$, into the total distribution of correlation times. \n",
